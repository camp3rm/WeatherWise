## Overview of WeatherWise

An interactive weather dashboard built with React. It provides users with current weather conditions, including temperature, weather icon, "feels like" temperature, cloudiness, chance of precipitation, as well as detailed information on UV index, wind, sunrise/sunset times, humidity, visibility, and pressure. Forecasts for the upcoming days and an hourly forecast are also available. It uses the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve data.
